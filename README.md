# NLP_SAME_QUESTION_CHECKER

## In this project I have did some data analytics and data engineering.

## Used Quara Dataset 

## A NLP Prject to help understand, engineer and analysis the data in order to get some usefull information and predictions from the dataset

## Data Visualization
First I examined the data buy checking if there is any null values in the data, duplicates and some graphs of how many repeated questions are there in the data set.

## Data Engineering 
Added the length (each indivuadial letters) of each questions to the data frame
![Q1_Length_analysis]{/NLP_QUESTIONS/q1_len_data_analysis.png}
![Q2_Length_analysis]{/NLP_QUESTIONS/q2_len_data_analysis.png}

Added the total number of words of each questions in the data frame
![Q1_No_OF_WORD]{NLP_QUESTIONS/q1_num_words_data_analysis.png}
![Q2_No_OF_WORD]{NLP_QUESTIONS/q2_num_words_data_analysis.png}
![TOTAL_No_OF_WORD]{NLP_QUESTIONS/total_words_data_analysis.png}

Also Added the total no of words that are overlapping

Adding total no of tokens and few other features in data engineering and ploting the graph to compare if those features are helpfull or not.

Also applied TSNE to better understande all the features together in 2D
